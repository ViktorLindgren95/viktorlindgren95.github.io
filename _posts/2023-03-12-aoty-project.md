# Introduction

I love music. I know that isnt a hot take to have but i really love music. As a person with both ADHD and Autism,
listening, consuming and making music (music that will never see the light of day its bad folks) has been an outlet for
me. There isnt a day that goes by where im not listening to music between 8-12 hours of my day. Its simply a way to shut
out the static that is constant in my head.

So because of me constantly listening and exploring new music, ive become some what of a taste maker. Not in the sense
that i have good taste, even tho i believe i do have good taste, but because i keep a good pulse on whats out there. I
do the digital crate digging almost daily and find new and interesting artists. So during the pandemic, when it wasent
possible for me and my friend to sit down and listen to vinyls and discuss music i decided that i would try to compile
what i thought was the best music created during my lifetime. I decided to keep it to a single album per year and so the
album of the year project was born. While there are so many more good albums released during these years, for example
some years are heavily contested, these are the following albums that i consider the best of their respective year.
